# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python script that generates educational flashcards using AI (Google Gemini 2.5) to create content and fetch relevant images from the internet. The flashcards will be bilingual (English-Chinese) with images, formatted as CSV output for easy import into flashcard applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to generate flashcards with English words, Chinese translations, and relevant images, so that I can study vocabulary more effectively with visual aids.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the script THEN the system SHALL generate flashcards using Google Gemini 2.5 API
2. WHEN generating flashcards THEN the system SHALL include an English word on the front
3. WHEN generating flashcards THEN the system SHALL include the Chinese translation on the back
4. WHEN generating flashcards THEN the system SHALL fetch a relevant image from the internet for each card
5. WHEN all flashcards are generated THEN the system SHALL output the results in CSV format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the AI model and specify topics or word lists, so that I can generate flashcards tailored to my learning needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a topic or word list THEN the system SHALL generate flashcards based on that input
2. WHEN the system connects to Google Gemini 2.5 THEN it SHALL authenticate using the provided API key
3. IF no specific topic is provided THEN the system SHALL generate general vocabulary flashcards
4. WHEN generating flashcards THEN the system SHALL ensure translations are accurate and contextually appropriate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically find and include relevant images for each flashcard, so that I have visual context to aid memorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a flashcard THEN the system SHALL search for and download a relevant image
2. WHEN searching for images THEN the system SHALL use the English word as the search query
3. WHEN an image is found THEN the system SHALL include the image URL or local path in the CSV output
4. IF no suitable image is found THEN the system SHALL continue without an image and log the issue
5. WHEN downloading images THEN the system SHALL handle network errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the flashcards exported in CSV format, so that I can easily import them into flashcard applications like Anki or Quizlet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flashcards are generated THEN the system SHALL create a CSV file with proper formatting
2. WHEN creating the CSV THEN the system SHALL include columns for: English word, Chinese translation, image path/URL
3. WHEN writing to CSV THEN the system SHALL handle special characters and encoding properly
4. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL save the CSV file with a descriptive filename
5. WHEN errors occur during CSV creation THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand the process status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other cards
3. WHEN the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message
4. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL display progress information to the user
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL save partial results before terminating
